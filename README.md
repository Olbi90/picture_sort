# picture_sort
picture_sort is a simple tool that let you sort your media. No fancy stuff, just sort!

At the moment the following filetypes are supported:
- .jpg
- .jpeg
- .png
- .heic
- .mov
- .mp4
- .avi
- .mkv

After each run, the program generates a file named *error.txt*.
This file serves as a log for any issues that occurred during the operation. It contains:

1. List of unsupported or failed files:
Every file that could not be moved or copied will be listed with its full path.

2. Total number of unsupported files
An absolute count of how many files could not be processed.

3. Operation summary
At the end of the file, a comparison is provided:
- Total number of files processed
- Number of files successfully moved/copied

> **Warning:**  
> The author does not take any responsibility for damage or lost files. Please use this tool with caution.  
> It is strongly recommended to always use **copy mode** instead of **move** to avoid accidental data loss.
